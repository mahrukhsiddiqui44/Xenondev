## Part 3: Process Thinking â€“ How I Would Improve QA in a Small Team?

QA work is mostly written, not just verbal. With the right approach and process, software quality can be managed effectively. Below are some key steps to improve QA processes in a small team:

1- Prepare a test plan before starting any project. It should be reviewed and approved by developers. Once finalized, the QA team can begin testing with a clear understanding of the scope.

2- Provide complete task details when assigning to QA, so testing can be done properly. This should include:

i-   Task description
ii-  Test environment
iii- Required test data
iv-  Deadline or timeline

3- Set up a proper bug reporting system with clear steps to reproduce, expected vs actual results, and screenshots. Use a tracking tool like ClickUp, Asana, or Jira to avoid losing or duplicating issues.

4- Document test cases, even if using a basic Google Sheet. Organize them by module or feature, it helps during regression and ensures proper coverage.

5- Perform quick smoke testing after every new build to ensure major functionality is working before deeper testing begins.
